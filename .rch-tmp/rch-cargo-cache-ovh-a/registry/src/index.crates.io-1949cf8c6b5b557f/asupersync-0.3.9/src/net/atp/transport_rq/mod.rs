//! ATP-over-RaptorQ transport (v1): the *fast, robust* ATP data plane.
//!
//! Where [`crate::net::atp::transport_tcp`] moves bytes over a single reliable
//! TCP stream, this transport is built for saturating the pipe on a lossy,
//! high-latency internet path:
//!
//! - **Data plane = RaptorQ fountain symbols over UDP.** Each file entry is
//!   erasure-coded ([`crate::raptorq`], RFC 6330 systematic RaptorQ) into source
//!   plus repair symbols. Symbols are *fungible*: any `K (+ε)` of them recover
//!   the entry, from any socket, in any order. Loss is absorbed by repair
//!   symbols instead of head-of-line-blocking retransmits.
//! - **Multi-socket fan-out.** Symbols are sprayed round-robin across `N` UDP
//!   sockets so a single flow's congestion control / per-socket buffer does not
//!   cap throughput.
//! - **Reliable control plane = one TCP connection** reusing the canonical
//!   `AtpFrameCodec`: handshake (transfer id + receiver UDP port + coding
//!   params), the transfer manifest, fountain *NeedMore* feedback, and the final
//!   verified receipt.
//!
//! # Integrity (fail-closed, identical guarantee to `transport_tcp`)
//!
//! After decode, the receiver (1) checks every entry's SHA-256 against the
//! manifest, (2) verifies the versioned logical-file and directory metadata
//! commitment, and
//! (3) rebuilds the deterministic flat
//! [`crate::atp::object::ObjectGraph`] and compares the flat Merkle root to the
//! manifest root. Only if both hold does it atomically write the destination and
//! report `committed = true`. Any mismatch, oversize entry, unreachable peer, or
//! undecodable transfer is a hard error.
//!
//! # Fountain feedback loop
//!
//! v1 uses a bounded request/response loop rather than a continuous concurrent
//! ARQ, which keeps it correct on the current runtime:
//!
//! 1. Sender sprays every entry's source symbols across the UDP sockets, plus
//!    optional initial repair symbols when `repair_overhead > 1.0`, then sends
//!    `ObjectComplete` on TCP.
//! 2. Receiver feeds arriving symbols into a per-entry [`DecodingPipeline`].
//!    On `ObjectComplete` it replies with either a `Proof` receipt (all entries
//!    decoded → verified + committed) or a `NeedMore` list of still-incomplete
//!    entry indices.
//! 3. For each `NeedMore` round the sender generates a *fresh* batch of repair
//!    symbols (higher ESI range — RaptorQ is rateless) for the listed entries
//!    and resprays. Bounded by `max_feedback_rounds`; exhausting them is a hard
//!    error, never a silent partial success.
//!
//! On a low-loss path the initial over-provision means round 0 succeeds; the
//! loop only engages under real loss, which the loopback loss-injection test
//! exercises deterministically.
